# School District Analysis

#3 Background

As the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Your first task is to analyze the district-wide standardized test results, including every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The goal is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### Instructions

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.


### District Summary
* Total number of unique schools
* Total students
* Total budget
*Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math
* % passing reading
* % overall passing
  
### School Summary
* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math
* % passing reading
* % overall passing

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

### Math Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
